# Brooks-Lint — Full Sweep & Auto-Fix

## Setup

1. Read `../../references/brooks/common.md` for the Iron Law, Project Config, Report Template, and Health Score rules
2. Read `../../references/brooks/source-coverage.md` for book-level coverage, exceptions, and tradeoffs
3. Read `../../references/brooks/decay-risks.md` for production risk symptom definitions
4. Read `../../references/brooks/test-decay-risks.md` for test risk symptom definitions
5. Read `sweep-guide.md` in this directory for the unified scan and fix process

## Process

**If the user has not specified a project or directory:** apply Auto Scope Detection
from `../../references/brooks/common.md` to determine the review scope before proceeding.

1. Show pre-flight consent notice and wait for the user's one-time approval (Step 0 of the guide)
2. Enumerate scope and initialize the `unresolvable` / `non_critical_rounds` / `fix_log` state (Step 1 of the guide)
3. Run the four dimensions in sequence — review, test, debt, audit — each scanning, classifying, applying Safe + Extended-Safe fixes, and verifying via the project test command (Steps 2–5 of the guide)
4. Iterate: re-scan modified files + same-module + static consumers; converge on a clean round, retire 3-retry failures to the `unresolvable` set, cap non-critical rounds at 3 (Step 6 of the guide)
5. Aggregate residual and unresolvable items and output the Full Sweep Report (Steps 7–8 of the guide)

**Mode line in report:** `Full Sweep`
